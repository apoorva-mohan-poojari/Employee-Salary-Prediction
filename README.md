#Employee Salary Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a person earns more than $50,000 per year using demographic and employment data from the UCI Adult Income dataset. Various machine learning algorithms such as KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and MLP Classifier are used for classification.
